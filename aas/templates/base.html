    <title>AAS Abstract Recommendations</title>

</head>
<body>

<p>
This is a proof of concept built at the AAS223 Hack Day on 2014-01-09 by
<a href="https://github.com/astrodsg">Dylan Gregersen</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/dima127">Dmitry Malyshev</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/dfm">Dan Foreman-Mackey</a>.
It provides recommendations for talks that you should have gone to and
posters that you should have seen based on your interests.
The code is (obviously) <a href="https://github.com/dfm/aas">on GitHub</a>
licensed under the MIT license but remember that it's a total hack.
